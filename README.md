# Ichi
My discord bot, designed to do very silly things.

# Setup
1. Rename config-example.json to config.json
2. Fill in all necessary information in config.json. `openCubeInstance` is optional but is required for the OpenCube Commands.
3. Open a terminal, and type `npm i` to install packages.
4. Run `node index` to start the bot.
